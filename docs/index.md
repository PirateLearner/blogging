## Usage

Basic Usage of the Blogging App is creating blog entries and navigate among them. App has three core entities :

* Content Type.
* Blog Parent.
* Blog Entries.

These three entities have the following relationship -

![Relationship between Core elements](relation.png "Logo Title Text 1")  

Content-Type can be of Non-Leaf(for Parent) or Leaf (Content) type and is necessary for creating Parent or Blog entries. Once Content-Type  is created, a hierarchy can be
generated by creating various Parents. Blog entires must have one Content-Type (Leaf) and one Parent(Non-leaf).

Workflow for creating Blog entries comprises of three steps:-

_At this point, I would like to encourage you to download the source from github alongwith its demo, and try out the demo for more clarity_

#### Create Content-Type

Content Type defines the Basic layout of the Article or its Parent.
URL for creating the Content-Type is ` {base_url}/content-type/ `, where `base_url` is the name given in `urls.py`. 
This url is the first step in the creation of Blog entries. Just click on the `+` hyperlink and a new window
will pop-up where you can create the Content-Type. 

__ please note that names cannot have space or special character as of now and Title fields is already include so do not add that in the fields area __

   
#### Create Blog Parent

Blog Parents are the _'non-leaf'_ type of entities. To create one, you will first need at least one
content-type of non-leaf kind.
The behaviour has been made such so that the user can also associate content with parents. 
For example, if we are creating a book, then we want to be able to not just write content in chapters, 
but also design cover pages to our liking, or perhaps, write synopsis to the chapters there.
Creation of `parent` nodes is similar to that of content nodes, and you can select a parent to the newly
created `parent` or section. This is just like associating a chapter to a book, or a section to a chapter 
(where all of them are titles).

I encourage you to put some descriptive image in the description field, as the app will parse the body
to fin dif any image link is there, and if found, it will use it as thumbnail.

__ Make sure that a Non-Leaf Content-Type is selected in Content-Type while creating the Parent __

#### Create Blog Entries 

Blog entries can be easily created from the front-end. First step is selecting the content-type and url is ` {base_url}/content-type/ `, click on the next button and then you
will have the layout as were selected while creating Content-Type.

__P.S.__ I understand the terminology is a little ambiguous right now, for a little headsup, to create 
presentational content, click on the buttons and to create schemas, click on the `+` button.
