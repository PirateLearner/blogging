Content-Type can be of Leaf(for Parent) or Non-Leaf (Blog) type and is necessary for creating Parent or Blog entries. Once Content-Type  is created hierarchy can be
generated by creating various Parents. Blog entires must have one Content-Type (Non-Leaf) and one Parent.

Workflow for creating Blog entries comparises of three steps:- 

#### Create Content-Type

Content Type defines the Basic layout of the Article or it's Parent.
url for crating the Content-Type is ` {base_url}/content-type/ `. This url is first step for creation of Blog entries. Just click on the `+` hyperlink and new window
will pop-up where you can create the Conten-Type. 

__ please note that Name can not have space or special character as of now and Title fields is already include so do not add that in the fields area __

   
#### Create Blog Parent

As of now creation of Blog parent is not supported from front-end, so you have to create the content type using Admin site of Django.
Just click on the `Blog Parent` link and generate the hierarchy you want in your blogging. 

__ Make sure that a Non-Leaf Content-Type is selected in Content-Type while crating the Parent __

#### Create Blog Entries 

Blog entries can be created from the front-end. First step is selecting the content-type and url is ` {base_url}/content-type/ `, click on the next button and then you
will have the layout as were selected while creating Content-Type.
